# Case-Study---Financial-Statements-in-PowerBI

## Tools Used: SQL, PowerBI

### Description
This is part of the requirements for completion of the Case Study - Financial Statements in PowerBI course, which I took as part of the Business Intelligence and Data Analyst (BIDA) certification offered by the Corporate Finance Institute in conjunction with alX.

In this case study, I took on the role of a Business Intelligence Developer whose task was to create a dashboard with previously created financial statement (the Income Statement, Balance Sheet, and Statement of Cash Flow) and automate the updating of the source data file whenever new information comes in.

This course covers the information shared in the Tableau Fundamentals course in addition to teaching these additional information:

• Write an SQL query to source General Ledger Data from a database

• Build a data model using a snowflake schema in Power BI

• Build an Income Statement and Balance Sheet in Power BI

• Create financial statements in Excel using Cube Formulas

• Compare the benefits of Power BI vs Excel for Financial Analysis
